    "DESCRIPTION": "🐔 This program simulates a production and consumption system on a farm. The producers are hens that lay eggs one by one. Once a batch of 6 eggs is ready, the consumers (workers) collect and pack them. The interface shows in real-time the number of eggs produced, packed, and the status of the hens and workers. Watch how the farm operates with precision and efficiency!",
